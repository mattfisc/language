  Exercise 7.1


(a) This occurs during run-time for it depends on the number.
(b) The meaning of char is part of static binding and occurs during language definition time.
(c) In C  and Java one can have dynamic or static arrays so the size of an array variable can be declared during compile or run-time.
(d) In C  and java the size of an array parameter is determined upon compile time.
(e) Variables in C are static.
    Variables in Java are objects so they can be changed at Run Time.
(f) A constant is statically bound at load time for this preset and the value doesn't change.
(g) In C functions are by default declared statically although if the function is declared 
    virtual it will become dynamic and execute at run-time.  In Java functions are also 
	static or dynamic so they are determined during run-time or compile.
	
  Exercise 7.2

 Early binding means the compiler is able to jump straight to the address of the function being called.  
 Late binding is less efficient because there is an extra step. Late binding is more flexible does not
 have to be identified at the compilation.
 
  Exercise 7.4
 
C++ is an extention of the C language.  C++ supports object oriented programming.  C does not support
classes and objects.  It focuses on methods.  C++ supports and is built around classes and objects.
C is focused on primitive data types where C++ also supports user-identified data types.

  Exercise 7.10
  
Dynamic scoping has an ability to statically check for references to nonlocal variables.    
Dynamics scoping also makes the program difficult to read because calling sequence needs to be known.
There is no way to protect local variables reguardless of the proximity.
Accessing non local variables takes longer.
